During my graduate studies, I focused on digital IC design, developing and researching multiple hardware architectures with hands-on RTL and system-level implementation. \n\n In 2023, I began my professional career at Synopsys, working on the optimization engine for the Fusion Compiler, and targetting advanced node PPA. I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Siemens.",
